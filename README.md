# Laplace

This project is part of the Master's degree thesis 
["Estimation of oxygen consumption
from partial pressure gradients in cortex"](https://github.com/martejulie/master-thesis),
written by Marte Julie Sætra, May 2016.
It illustrates the use of the Laplace method, described and explored in Chapter 
2, 6 and 7. Details on smoothing is given in Chapter 3.

The project is not an exact reproduction of all the code I have used, but serves
as example. Main code is found in `generateExampleData` and `analyzeExperimentalData`.
