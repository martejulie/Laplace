# Laplace

This project is part of the Master's degree thesis 
"Estimation of oxygen consumption
from partial pressure gradients in cortex", written by Marte Julie Sætra, May 2016.
It illustrates the use of the Laplace method, described and explored in Chapter 
2, 6 and 7. Details on smoothing is given in Chapter 3.

The project is not an exact reproduction of the all the code I have used, but serves
as example.
